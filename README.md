# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This web application allows users to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent. Below, I'll explain the design choices I made and how I used CSS to realize those changes.

## Design Choices

### Overall Layout

- **Background Color**: I chose a light gray background color (#f2f2f2) to create a visually appealing and neutral backdrop for the game.

- **Font**: I used the Arial font for a clean and readable text style.

### Heading (h1)

- **Font Size**: I set the font size of the heading to 24px for a prominent title.

- **Color**: The heading text is in a dark gray color (#333) to maintain readability and contrast with the background.

### Player Display

- **Player Containers**: I added div elements with the class "player" to display each player's name and choice side by side. This design enhances the organization of player information.

- **Player Names**: Player names ("Player 1" and "Player 2") are displayed above their respective images. I used a bold font and a slightly smaller font size (16px) to distinguish player names.

- **Player Images**: Images are centered and have a maximum width of 200px on larger screens and 150px on smaller screens. This ensures that the images remain appropriately sized across different devices.

### Play Button

- **Button Style**: I created a rounded button with a background color of #007BFF and white text for a more visually appealing and interactive button. On hover, the background color changes to #0056b3, providing user feedback.

### Responsive Design

- **Media Queries**: I implemented media queries to make the page responsive. The design adjusts for screens with a maximum width of 600px. In smaller screens, fonts and image sizes are reduced, and the button padding is decreased to maintain a pleasing layout.

## How CSS Was Used

CSS played a crucial role in achieving the desired design for this Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Here's how CSS was used:

- **Styling**: CSS was used to set fonts, colors, margins, padding, and backgrounds to create an attractive and readable design.

- **Button Styling**: CSS was employed to create rounded buttons, define their appearance, and implement hover effects for a better user experience.

- **Layout**: CSS was used to organize the layout of player information, including player names and images, using div containers and appropriate margins.

- **Responsive Design**: Media queries were utilized to make the page responsive, ensuring that the game remains accessible and visually appealing on various screen sizes.

These design choices and CSS implementations were made to enhance the user experience, making the Rock, Paper, Scissors game more engaging and aesthetically pleasing.
